<p>Atkinson Hyperlegible, named after the founder of the Braille Institute, has been developed specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve comprehension.</p>

<p>Having a traditional grotesque sans-serif at its core, it departs from tradition to incorporate unambiguous, distinctive elements—and at times, unexpected forms—always with the goal of increasing character recognition and ultimately improve reading.</p>
    
<p>Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono is an entirely new typeface inspired by Atkinson Hyperlegible. The characters in a monospace typeface all occupy the same width, allowing for them to be scanned quickly in table-based and coding environments. The glyphs in Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono are newly created for this variation, and unique to the typeface.</p>
